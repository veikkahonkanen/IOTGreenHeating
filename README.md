# IoTGreenHeating
IoT system that based on the current green energy production and temperature controls the heating system accordingly. The documentation of this project can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17gStytAsK--wiyyjuZHbbfm60SY5j2aJcIG8j6UO04s/edit?usp=sharing). Made on Internet of Things course of Aarhus University in fall 2020 together with David F. Marquez https://github.com/DavidMarquezF and Ondrej Viskup https://github.com/onJv.


# Features

For this project it is important to have a set of mandatory goals and some possible extensions so that

## Required

* [ ] Collect data through webhooks from the weather forecast and the green energy production API
* [ ] Display green energy production percentage
* [ ] Display temperature inside and outside
* [ ] Control a heating system (two options):
  * Stub heating system that will be controlled by the IOTGreeHeating (probably just a display/LED or something of the likes)
  * Use small heater to heat a small environment (a box for example) to simulate how it would work in a big room

## Extensions

* [ ] Predict the green energy production so that even if the device is not connected it will be able to operate correctly
* [ ] Notifications
* [ ] Generation of different charts that could be displayed in thingspeak
* [ ] Make the system flexible so that the user can use different API to obtain weather or green energy data
* [ ] Quantify the amount of green energy you have used in comparison to what would have been used if this system wasn't in place
* [ ] Predict thermal inertia based on thermal readings from other days so that the heating system can be controlled more efficiently
* [ ] Good interface with graphics in the display

# Plan

## Data
We will be using data from [Energi Data Service](https://www.energidataservice.dk/) which offers multiple datasets accessible with an API (we will be able to use webhooks).

* [Energy production type](https://www.energidataservice.dk/tso-electricity/electricitybalancenonv) (useful if we prefer to use as much green energy as possible)
* [Production general information](https://www.energidataservice.dk/tso-electricity/powersystemrightnow) 
* [CO2 prognosis](https://www.energidataservice.dk/tso-electricity/co2emisprog)

For the outside conditions (temperature and humidity) we will use data from [OpenWeatherMapAPI](https://openweathermap.org/api) which offers multiple weather APIs (both free and paid).

* [Current weather](https://openweathermap.org/current)

## Hardware

### Sensors
 * DHT22 temperature / humidity
 
### Actuators
 * SSD1306 Display (will display the sensor data)

 * Relay + resistor of 5 watts (heater) or simulated (will output heat in case the heater is turned on)
